    <p>My topic explores the role and value of human designers in a future where AI plays a important role in creative industries. As AI tools continues to evolve, they are increasinly more capable of generating layouts, branding systems, graphics, websites, and more. The target audience is those who are in the creative industries, those who are curious about their future in the era where AI go viral.</p>

    <p>My topic relys on three design lenses, including speculative deisgn, challenging mental models, and the utopian/distopian narratives. The topic imagines the futures for the relationship between designer and AI. It questions the mental models that design works should be creative, human, authentic, and so on. It also explores hopeful and troubling futrues to highlight the decisions we face today.</p>

    <p>Some of the features that my project will be including:
        <ul>
            <li>An interactive narrative interface that lets user explore multiple speculative futures:
                <ul>
                    <li>A utopia where designers collaborate with AI's equally</li>
                    <li>A distopia where design is fully automated and dehumanized</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Decision points where user chooses and see how that shape the ending future</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>I am still figuring out how to balance storytelling and speculative fiction. I am also unsure how to build the branching pathways effectively and efficienly. Additionally, I don't know is there enough time for me to achieve the result I want for this project while balancing the workload from this class and other classes.</p>
