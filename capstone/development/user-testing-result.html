    <h1>Usability Testing & Results</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Three Significant Observations</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Users initially hesitate at choice-based interactions:</strong><br>
        Testers paused at moments where they were expected to choose between utopian and dystopian outcomes. This suggests that while the branching narrative is clear, the stakes or meanings of the choices could be made more intuitive.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Visuals spark interest but are sometimes ambiguous:</strong><br>
        Participants found the visual design compelling. However, some icons or interface elements weren't clearly tied to their function, leading to clicks on non-interactive visuals.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Conceptual impact is strong once understood:</strong><br>
        After brief exploration, users reported the experience was "thought-provoking" and “surprisingly emotional,” especially when reaching the more dystopian outcomes. This confirms that the project does communicate its core themes effectively—once the user engages fully.</p>

        <h2>Key Questions Addressed</h2>
        <p><strong>Aspects that need improvement:</strong><br>
        Clearer signposting for interactive elements, visual distinctions between clickable and non-clickable components, and short tooltips to provide guidance on ambiguous choices.</p>

        <p><strong>Can users figure out how to navigate/interact with your project?</strong><br>
        Partially. Users could interact after initial exploration, but early confusion over what was interactive slowed down their experience.</p>

        <p><strong>Does the project deliver the intended message?</strong><br>
        Yes. The contrast between human-centered and AI-dominated futures comes across clearly. The branching consequences highlight the stakes of design and technology in shaping society.</p>
